## Demultiplexer
Demultiplexer is a fundamental concept used to manage multiple streams of data
or multiple inputs directed to a single output or processing unit.

It's commonly used in scenarios where multiple sources need to share a single
resource or when a single input is capable of carrying multiple signals or data
streams.

In the context of I/O operations and networking:
- Input/Output Operations: A demultiplexer helps manage multiple I/O
operations, allowing a system to handle various input sources or events
without blocking the processing of other tasks.

- Networking: In networking, a demultiplexer is crucial for handling
multiple connections or streams of data over a single network channel.
It helps identify and direct incoming packets to the appropriate sockets
or applications based on their respective addresses or ports.

For example, in a web server handling multiple incoming requests from different
clients, a demultiplexer can identify which client's request is ready for
processing and direct that specific request to the server's processing unit
without blocking other requests.

The demultiplexer is responsible for efficiently managing these inputs or
events, ensuring that each one gets processed as needed without causing delays
or bottlenecks in the system. It's an essential component in handling concurrent
operations and managing resources effectively.

## Dispatcher
dispatcher serves as a coordinator or supervisor responsible for directing and
assigning tasks to the appropriate processing units or handlers based on certain
criteria or events.

Here's an analogy:

Dispatcher in a Transport Hub:

Imagine a dispatcher at a transport hub, like an airport or a train station.
Their primary role is to manage the flow of incoming and outgoing
vehicles—planes, trains, buses, etc.

- Incoming Vehicles (Connections): When new vehicles arrive, the dispatcher
evaluates each vehicle and determines its destination or route.
For instance, a plane from New York might need to go to Los Angeles, and a
train from London might be headed to Paris.

- Assigning Routes (Handling Tasks): The dispatcher decides which vehicle
goes where, directing them to specific gates or platforms based on their
destinations. Similarly, in a computing context, the dispatcher assigns
incoming connections or data streams to the appropriate handlers or
processing units.

- Efficient Flow: By efficiently assigning vehicles to their respective paths,
the dispatcher ensures smooth and organized movement without congestion or
delays. Likewise, a dispatcher in computing ensures that tasks or data are
processed effectively without causing bottlenecks or interruptions.

In computing terms, a dispatcher within a system—like a network or
server—handles incoming events or data. For instance, in a server managing
multiple client connections:

- Incoming Connections: The dispatcher identifies new client connections
arriving at the server.

- Assignment of Processing: It decides which part of the system should handle
each connection—routing each client request to its respective processing
unit or function for appropriate action.

- Smooth Processing: By efficiently directing incoming requests to the right
places, the dispatcher ensures that all tasks are handled without
overwhelming any specific part of the system, allowing for smooth and timely
processing.

Both the dispatcher and demultiplexer play integral roles in managing and handling multiple inputs or events within a system, ensuring that tasks are efficiently distributed and processed without causing congestion or delays.
